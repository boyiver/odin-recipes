        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I'm showing you my favorite way to grill ribs, 
            which of course, is not the same as barbecued ribs. 
            Those are cooked low and slow in a smoker and served as-is, 
            with BBQ sauce on the side. Whereas, these are cooked first, 
            then sliced, and then each rib is glazed with our 
            beautiful sticky sauce on the grill.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Glaze:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                 salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for 
                dry rub together in a small bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. 
                Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. 
                Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits 
                across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; 
                this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides 
                with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. 
                Wrap tightly with foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 
                hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. 
                Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to 
                overnight.
            </li>
            <li>P
                reheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. 
                Slice between the bones to separate each rib.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and 
                cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and 
                brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as 
                caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
