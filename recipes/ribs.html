        <p class="text content">
            I'm showing you my favorite way to grill ribs, 
            which of course, is not the same as barbecued ribs. 
            Those are cooked low and slow in a smoker and served as-is, 
            with BBQ sauce on the side. Whereas, these are cooked first, 
            then sliced, and then each rib is glazed with our 
            beautiful sticky sauce on the grill.

        <div class="text section">Ingredients</div>
        <ul class="text content">
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text sub-section">For the Glaze:</div>
        <ul class="text content">
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="text section">Steps</div>
        <ol class="text content">
            <li class="text content">
                Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Mix salt, sugar, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder for 
                dry rub together in a small bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Line a large sheet pan with heavy-duty aluminum foil. 
                Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. 
                Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits 
                across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; 
                this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides 
                with rub; flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. 
                Wrap tightly with foil.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 
                hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. 
                Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to 
                overnight.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. 
                Slice between the bones to separate each rib.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and 
                cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and 
                brush over glaze. Flip and repeat process until ribs are as 
                caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li class="text content">
                Remove to a plate and brush over one more application of glaze. Serve.
